# Pagination
In this code file using Html,css, Javascript and react worked on creating pagination.
-> Firstly, taken the API from JSON placeholder which contains the data with 100 objects. So with the pagination concept for ever render it display 10 objects with the page number, next and prev button that perform the certain operations by clicking on it.
->clicking the 1 number button will show the data of first 10 array of objects, similarly clicking the 8th button will show 80 to 90 array objects contains and also similarly prev and next button will work previous and next page concepts.

In this entire code i have used two external components and jsonplaceholder sample API.
